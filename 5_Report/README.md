 * This Project is an **Wiper control system** , a wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
 * We are trying to simulate this project on **stmcube 32 IDE**

# ABSTRACT
1) The Wiper speed control system controls the operational speed of the wiper in accordance with the rain condition. 
2) It cleans raindrops or any other liquids off the vehicle's windscreen. 
3) The prior system required mannual wiper activation, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage.
4)  As a result, this method is proposed to address this issue. The project's goals are to improve ageing the automobile systems by giving automated transmission.
5)  Most of the cars have two wipers, one on the rear window and other on the front glass.
6)   The wipers parts visible from the cars are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. 
7)   the warn gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.
8)    Now a days we have the automated control wiper system whenever we stop wiping in between the process it will automatically come to initial position this is the new wiper system behind the wiper arm.
9)   This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing conventional wipers.
